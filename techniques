Before solving the question:
- Ask anything about the question and the data involved
- Using brure force for firs step is acceptable
- Write Pseudo code first


Approches to solve problem:
1. Examplify: make different examples
2. Pattern matching with known solutions or algorithms
3. Simplify and Genralize
4. Base case and build. For Problems with 8 input data, first solve it for 1 or 2.
5. Data structure Brainstorm
