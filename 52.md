  -  When we have sessions and multiple servers, the Load Balancer would not know which server should serve each request, there are two options to solve this issue:
    1. Use cookie. Inside it we can define the server ID we connect the first time
    2. Use a session server to save sessions there
  Although I think using JWT or any claim based sysytem would be much more easier.
  - Each node which is single can be a point of failure.
